Although I don't want to do every housework, doing dishes can always beat dirty housework like "washing the toilet" and rank first and become my most disliked work.

There are more than 20 questions and answers about dishwashing on the social media platform, some of which I find very interesting.

"What kind of music, for example, will make a person not hate doing dishes?" It makes me wonder why people hate doing the dishes so much.


## You will be labeled as "sloppy" if you do not wash the dishes within half an hour of eating.

First, I'd like to coin a phrase: compulsive housework.

The term "compulsive housework" refers to the requirement that you complete this housework immediately and without hesitation.

Cooking, to use an analogy, is an active chore. You won't starve to death if you don't do it, but if you do, it's a thing with high psychological added value—not only can you take pictures and send them to Moments, eat (probably delicious) homemade food, but you can also gain a lot of self-hypnosis. A "more self-sufficient and better life."

However, dishwashing is a type of compulsive housework. Not only is there no technical content—you should wash cleanly, but you will be chastised if you don't—but there is also a "time limit for action"—the sink bowls are nearly full. Can you take care of your life (and your work) if you don't wash it when you're done? And there is no such thing as "strong motivation"—the purpose of cooking is to eat, and washing dishes is simply cleanup.

When things become forced, the fundamental premise of freedom and happiness is undermined. The popular "sudden cleanliness" cleaning style is completely unsuitable for housework such as dishwashing, which means that dishwashing is doomed to have no sense of accomplishment.

## 2 You might not understand the true meaning of dishwashing.

It is said that dishes is only one thing you need to do. But the truth is, you need to do:

wash the dishes

wash the pots

Cleaning knives, cutting boards, forks and spoons, and other tools

Remove the grease from the stove.

Clean up the kitchen counters.

Gather leftover ingredients and store them in the refrigerator.

brush the dirty sink

clean the floor

mop

garbage bag

New trash bag

Throw out the trash

"Look! It's not as easy as simply doing the dishes!"

## 3 Additional Costs

Washing dishes is not only a complicated process, but it also has some hidden costs.

Water and oil, for example, will inevitably splash during the washing process. If you move too much, the sewage will flow to the sink cabinet's surface. The jacket may be splattered with water, the trousers may be scratched, and the indoor slippers may be filthy.

After you've washed the dishes, you'll need to change your clothes and probably take a shower. " Doing dish is not worth the loss of washing yourself as well." Every time when I wash the dishes, I will feel that I am wasting my time and energy. I would rather spend my time on a total loss of boredom.
