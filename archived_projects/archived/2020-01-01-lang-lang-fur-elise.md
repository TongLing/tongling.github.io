title: Für Elise" Performed by Lang Lang
description: Lang Lang says, "For me it is very romantic, and light, like a feather. It has to come from nowhere and it has to touch people. It can’t just be treated as background music. I’ve tried to play the piece as the masterpiece that it is, and I hope that children who begin learning 'Für Elise' will treat it the same way."
