Doctors are people, not gods, we can only do our best, that‚Äôs all.</p> <p>No matter how advanced medicine is, it still has its limits. With current technology, one can survive without heart, lungs, and kidneys, but is it possible to live a lifetime with a machine like this?</p> <p>Nature has spring, summer, autumn and winter. Can a gardener change this law? Of course, there is no way, the gardener can only make the flowers bloom better in spring, summer. But he can‚Äôt save flowers in late autumn and winter. Can a doctor have a way to rescue people‚Äôs life, getting younger, help recover from sickness, and fight with death? Impossible.

In this process, we constantly pursue a problem.

The three of us went to the French restaurant on the second floor of the Sheraton Hotel, and we spend 26,000 yuan ($800), an average of 9,000 yuan ($260) per person! When I saw the bill, my face turned green, why is it so expensive! I‚Äôve never been to such a place, and I don‚Äôt know what dishes I ordered cost 26,000 yuan. The next morning, I went to the toilet and kept looking at my toilet. This thing cost me 9,000 yuan. It seems that I went to the food court and just eat a buffet of 70 yuan. When I was in the toilet, I suddenly realized that the glory and wealth of life is nothing but a piece of shit.</p> <div class="row"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/project/wisdom-of-death-and-life/28-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/project/wisdom-of-death-and-life/28-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/project/wisdom-of-death-and-life/28-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project/wisdom-of-death-and-life/28.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>The most important ‚Äòlife wisdom‚Äô of Chinese people is Confucianism, but ‚ÄúThe Analects of Confucius‚Äù says that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know life, how can you know death‚Äù, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt deal with people, how can you deal with ghosts‚Äù, ‚Äúlife, deal with courtesy; death, bury it. With rites and sacrifices with rites‚Äù, in short, I don‚Äôt want to talk about death. If you keep asking, it will say ‚Äúto sacrifice one‚Äôs life for righteousness‚Äù, ‚Äúto hear the Dao in the evening can die‚Äù. Confucianism adopts an evasive attitude towards the question of life and death, that is, it does not want to discuss it.</p> <p>The positive side of this approach, of course, is that it makes people pay attention to the time of life, but after all, there is no answer to death.</p> <p>My personal opinion is ‚Äúdeath and then life‚Äù. Only when we face death, can we see what life really is. Everyone will eventually die, and life is just a process of pursuing the meaning of life.</p> <p>Life should be like a raised to the nth power. If a is greater than 1, the nth power of a is infinite; if a is less than 1, the nth power of a quickly approaches zero. Do you know what this means? If I give more to the society than I take, it means that a is greater than 1. Everyone is like this, and the society will get better and better. If everyone takes more than they give to the society, it means that a is less than 1, and the society will soon collapse</p> <p>I use the following sentence as the conclusion of today:</p> <p>‚ÄúThe most difficult thing is not to face all kinds of setbacks and blows, but to face all kinds of setbacks and blows without losing enthusiasm for the world.‚Äù</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2019 - 2024 Tong Ling.
