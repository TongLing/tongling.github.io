I decided to take BUSADM 714 course: Multivariate Techniques in Management Research: Multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, factor analysis, conjoint analysis, bootstrap resampling, cluster analysis, canonical correlation, data mining (classification trees and neural networks); computer implementation. It was the best decision in my doctoral study. The statistical analysis skills I learned from [Dr Haas](https://uwm.edu/business/people/haas-timothy/) became the most useful skills in my research!
