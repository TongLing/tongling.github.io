I'm proud to announce I bought my first home in United States today, in my mid 20s! It is one of my proudest moments. The best thing is, I can pay my hard-earned money without stress. I use my own money to afford the down payment, furnitures, maintenances..., A couple of months later, I start to feel it would be very hard to give up living in Milwaukee.
