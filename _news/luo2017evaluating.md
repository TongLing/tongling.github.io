In my undergraduate research lab, profeesor Lingyun Luo, me, and other collaborators completed a 2-year long project, and published a paper [Evaluating the granularity balance of hierarchical relationships within large biomedical terminologies towards quality improvement](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046417302204) in Journal of Biomedical Informatics.
