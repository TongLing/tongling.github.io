Our two abstract articles `Association between Socioeconomic Disparity, Diagnostic Factors and Senior Adult Falls` and `ACE: An AI-Based, Criteria-Driven, Explainable Approach to Counteract Health Misinformation By Empowering Critical Thinking` has been accepted to the [2023 AcademyHealth Annual research meeting](https://academyhealth.org/page/2023-arm-registration) at Seattle.  I will complete a poster presentation in the meeting.
