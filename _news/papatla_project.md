I joined in Dr papatla's team and work on the [Elecurator Project](https://www.elecurator.com/). This project tracks the major issues engaging both candidates and voters in the 2020 election cycle. We applied a technique known as social curation to multiple sources of data ranging from traditional political polls and debate transcripts to political advertising and social media dialogue.
