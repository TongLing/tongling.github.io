We are working on a topic called Interpretable Model for Senior Adult Falls.The objective is to (1) Develop ML models to predict the patients survival after falls based on FH data set and extracted features ( demographics, immunizations, diagnosis, medications, allergy, vitals and procedures).(2) Use SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to explain the model from a data set level and individual patient level. (3) Discuss how this type of interpretations may be integrated into physician-oriented EHRs to make recommendations, or support decision making. More information iwill be available soon.
