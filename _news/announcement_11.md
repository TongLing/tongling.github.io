I'm proud to announce I just bought my first home in United States... in my mid 20s! It is one of my proudest moments. The best thing is, I can afford all the fees without stress, down payment, furnitures, maintenances..., A couple of months later, I start to feel it would be very hard to give up living in Milwaukee.
