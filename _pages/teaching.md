## Teaching Interest

##### Undergraduate course:

- As mentioned, I'm particularly interested in hands-on training courses in the general areas of healthcare professions. This includes my teaching on computational software, including Microsoft Excels and Healthcare Databases. These are two areas I see most undergraduate students are in lack of skills. Besides, I'm also happy to teach entry level statistical courses. I'm happy to bring my statistical knowledge from my background to future healthcare professionals. In addition, if campus is looking for a introductor for entry-level programming courses and database courses, I can also teach these courses in undergraduate level.

##### Graduate course:

- The interdisciplinary of Engineering and Healthcare are unmet needs in industry. The industry will need a large number of administrative and development professionals in next 5-10 years. I believe a hands-on training course related to Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare would be in high demand and become a highlight in course catalog. Besides, I'm also able to lecture advanced level statistical courses, including public health and research-based statistical knowledges. Statistics and evidence-based research is an important part that every healthcare graduate student needs to understand. Also, I'm able to host small interactive seminars for graduate students and help them gain experiences in academic peer discussion, and public presentation.
