**I will be joining into the Department of Neurology in McGovern Medical School, an affiliation of UTHealth (University of Texas Health Science Center) at Houston in 2023 Summer.**
## Biography

I'm Ling Tong (童凌) in the Department of Health Informatics and Administration at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/), and I'm currently working in [Center for Biomedical Data and Language Processing](https://sites.uwm.edu/jakeluo/). My primary research interests are medical informatics and artificial intelligence. 

I co-authored over ~~10~~ ~~15~~ **20** publications in biomedical informatics, clinical informatics, and computer science journals. Some are on top journals, such as Journal of Biomedical Informatics, JMIR AI, and IEEE Computer Software and Applications Conference. I have also been a reviewer for medical informatics journals.

I'm an active member of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and served as a reviewer for AMIA's conference proceedings. I have worked under the research projects funded by National Institute of Health(NIH), National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC), and Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin Endowment (AHW).

I've been teaching a healthcare computational tools course since 2019. I believe that each of us must decide how we will lead in times of great challenge. I encourage students to face challenges, and teaching them to be life-long learners.

## My Research and Teaching 

My research interest is on health care population studies. I have developed quantitative methods to analyze the gaps and inequities in telemedicine and health care, especially in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. My paper Telemedicine Adoption during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Gaps and Inequalities was among the top 10% cited paper of Applied Clinical Informatics Journal in 2021. 

Also, I'm interested in AI applications in medicine. My goal is to explore the interactions between AI models and Electronic Health Records, and how AI make precision medicine possible. One of my major research objectives is to leverage Electronic Health Record data to improve machine learning model's transparency.
