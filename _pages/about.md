## Biography

I'm Ling Tong (童凌). I'm currently working at [University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston](https://www.uth.edu/). My primary research interests are medical informatics and artificial intelligence. 

I currently participate in the BICAN’s Coordinating Unit for Biostatistics, Informatics, and Engagement (CUBIE) project. This project is designed to provide effective coordination benefits to the awardee network, the NIH, and the scientific community. Specifically, I participate and contribute to the development of meta-data and study-level interfaces for the Specimen Portal and the Sequencing Portal, including programming using agile methodology, expanding the integrative testing set of scripts, and incorporating user feedbacks into future versions of the portals.

I co-authored over 20 publications in biomedical informatics, clinical informatics, and computer science journals. Some are on top journals, such as Journal of Biomedical Informatics, JMIR AI, and IEEE Computer Software and Applications Conference. I have also been a reviewer for medical informatics journals.

I'm an active member of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and served as a reviewer for AMIA's conference proceedings. I have worked under the research projects funded by National Institute of Health(NIH), National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC), and Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin Endowment (AHW).

## My Research and Teaching 

My research interest is on health care population studies. I have developed quantitative methods to analyze the gaps and inequities in telemedicine and health care, especially in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. My paper Telemedicine Adoption during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Gaps and Inequalities was among the top 10% cited paper of Applied Clinical Informatics Journal in 2021. 

I'm also interested in AI applications in medicine. My goal is to explore the interactions between AI models and Electronic Health Records, and how AI make precision medicine possible. One of my major research objectives is to leverage Electronic Health Record data to improve machine learning model's transparency.
