**I'm actively interviewing to advance my career in a assistant professor or postdoc position in the United States. If you are looking for candidates specialized in AI in biomedical informatics, please do not hesitate to reach out.**

I'm Ling Tong (童凌), a PhD candidate in the Department of Health Informatics and Administration at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/), and I'm currently working in [Center for Biomedical Data and Language Processing](https://sites.uwm.edu/jakeluo/). My primary research interests are `medical informatics` and `artificial intelligence`. 

- I focus on health care population studies. I have developed quantitative methods to analyze the gaps and inequities in telemedicine and health care, especially in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. My paper `Telemedicine Adoption during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Gaps and Inequalities` was among the top 10% cited paper of Applied Clinical Informatics Journal in 2021. 

- In terms of AI, my goal is to explore the interactions between AI models and Electronic Health Records, and how AI make precision medicine possible. One of my major research objectives is to leverage Electronic Health Record data to improve machine learning model's transparency. Our recent study of AI-based health news evaluation was accepted on [JMIR AI](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/37751/accepted).
  
I co-authored over 20 publications in biomedical informatics, clinical informatics, and computer science journals. Some are on top journals, such as `Journal of Biomedical Informatics`, `JMIR AI`, `Biomedical Signal Processing and Control`, `IEEE Computer Software and Applications Conference`, and `Applied Clinical Informatics`. I have also been a reviewer for many journals, including `IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics`, `Journal of Medical Internet Research(JMIR)`, `Health Informatics Journal`, and `Computers in Biology and Medicine`.  

I'm an active member of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and served as a reviewer for AMIA's conference proceedings. I have worked under the research projects funded by National Institute of Health(NIH), National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC), and Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin Endowment (AHW).

I've been teaching a healthcare computational tools course since 2019. I believe that each of us must decide how we will lead in times of great challenge. I encourage students to face challenges, and teaching them to be life-long learners.

I was born and raised in 丽水([Lishui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lishui)), a beautiful town of China. After I finish my Bachelor degree in CS, I moved to United States and begins my doctoral study. In my spare time, I like to play the piano/guitar, make music, and spend time with my bandmates.
