Hi, Thank you for visiting!

I'm Ling Tong (童凌), a PhD student in the Department of Medical Informatics at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/), and I'm currently working in [Center for Biomedical Data and Language Processing](https://sites.uwm.edu/jakeluo/).

My primary research interests are `medical informatics` and `Artificial Intelligence`. I am working on Statistical Modeling and Quantitative Analysis of Electronic Health Records as part of my PhD studies. I also work on Artificial Intelligence topics such as Machine Learning diagnosis, Clinical Predictive Models, and Medical Text Mining.

For the past four years, I've been teaching a healthcare computational tools course. I believe that each of us must decide how we will lead in times of great challenge, and I am committed to overcoming the obstacles and teaching students to be life-long learners. 

I was born and raised in a small Chinese town until I finished my undergraduate studies. In my spare time, I like to play the piano/guitar, make music, and spend time with my bandmates.
