Hi, Thank you for visiting!

I'm Ling Tong (童凌), a PhD student in the Department of Medical Informatics at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/), and I'm currently working in [Center for Biomedical Data and Language Processing](https://sites.uwm.edu/jakeluo/).

My primary research interests are `medical informatics` and `artificial intelligence`. I am working on Statistical Modeling and Quantitative Analysis of Electronic Health Records as part of my PhD studies. I'm also interested in machine learning diagnosis, clinical predictive models, medical text mining, and natural language processing.

For the past four years, I've been teaching a healthcare computational tools course. I believe that each of us must decide how we will lead in times of great challenge, and I am committed to overcoming the obstacles and teaching students to be life-long learners. 

I was born and raised in 丽水([Lishui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lishui)), a beautiful town of China. After I finish my Bachelor degree in CS, I moved to United States and begins my doctoral study. In my spare time, I like to play the piano/guitar, make music, and spend time with my bandmates.
