Hi, Thanks for stopping by! 

I'm Ling Tong (童凌), a PhD candidate in the Department of Medical Informatics at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/), currently working at [Dr Jake Luo](https://sites.uwm.edu/jakeluo/)'s lab. 

My primary focus is on the intersection of `medical informatics` and `Artificial Intelligence`. During my PhD studies, I work on Statistical Modelling, Quantitative Analysis on Electronic Health Records. I'm also working on the topics of Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning diagnosis, Clinical Predictive Models and Medical Text Mining. 

I've been teaching on healthcare computational tools course for the past 4 years. I believe each of us must determine how we will lead in times of great challenge -- and I'm committed to overcome the difficulties, and teach students to become a life-long learner. 

I was born and raised in a small town of China until completing my undergradutate study. In my spare time, I enjoy playing piano/guitar, producing music, and enjoy time with bandmates.
