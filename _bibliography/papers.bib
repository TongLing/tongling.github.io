%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

title = {Interpretable Machine Learning Text Classification for Computed Tomography Reports – A Case Study of Temporal Bone Fracture},
author = {L Tong, J Luo, J Adams, X Liu, K Osinski, D Friedland},
year = {2022},
journal = {Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine},
abstract= {Background
Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated success in classifying patients’ diagnostic outcomes in free-text clinical notes. However, due to the machine learning model’s complexity, interpreting mechanisms of classification results remains difficult.
Methods
We investigated interpretable representations of machine learning classification models. We created machine learning models to classify temporal bone fractures based on 164 temporal bone Computed Tomography (CT) text reports. We adopted the XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. To interpret models, we used two major methodologies: (1) We calculated the average word frequency score (WFS) for keywords. The word frequency score shows the frequency gap between positive and negative classified cases. (2) We used Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to show the word-level contribution to bone fracture classification.
Results
In temporal bone fracture classification, the random forest model achieved an average F1-score of 0.93. WFS reveals a difference in keyword usage between fracture and non-fracture cases. Additionally, LIME visualized the keywords’ contributions to classification results. The evaluation of LIME-based interpretation achieved the highest interpreting accuracy of 0.97.
Conclusion
The interpretable text explainer can improve physicians’ understanding of machine learning predictions. By providing simple visualization, our model can increase the trust of computerized models. Our model supports more transparent computerized decision-making in clinical settings.},
