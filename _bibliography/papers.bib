  title={Interpretable Machine Learning Text Classification for Computed Tomography Reports – A Case Study of Temporal Bone Fracture},
  author={Tong, Ling and Luo,Jake and Adams, Jazzmyne and Liu, Xiaoyu and Osinski, Kathleen and Fridland, David},
  abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated success in classifying patients’ diagnostic outcomes in free-text clinical notes. However, due to the machine learning model’s complexity, interpreting mechanisms of classification results remains difficult.
Methods
We investigated interpretable representations of machine learning classification models. We created machine learning models to classify temporal bone fractures based on 164 temporal bone Computed Tomography (CT) text reports. We adopted the XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. To interpret models, we used two major methodologies: (1) We calculated the average word frequency score (WFS) for keywords. The word frequency score shows the frequency gap between positive and negative classified cases. (2) We used Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to show the word-level contribution to bone fracture classification.
Results
In temporal bone fracture classification, the random forest model achieved an average F1-score of 0.93. WFS reveals a difference in keyword usage between fracture and non-fracture cases. Additionally, LIME visualized the keywords’ contributions to classification results. The evaluation of LIME-based interpretation achieved the highest interpreting accuracy of 0.97.
Conclusion
The interpretable text explainer can improve physicians’ understanding of machine learning predictions. By providing simple visualization, our model can increase the trust of computerized models. Our model supports more transparent computerized decision-making in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective To determine the impact of patient demographics and social determinants of health on treatment pathways for unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) at a tertiary laryngology clinic. Study design Retrospective medical record review. Methods Patient demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, and insurance status) were extracted for adults diagnosed with UVFP between 2009 and 2019. Odds ratios for the associations between sociodemographic factors and UVFP treatment pathways were determined by chi-square analyses. Results A total of 1490 UVFP diagnoses were identified during the study period with the majority being female (58\%), White (85\%), non-Hispanic (97\%), and publicly insured (54\%). Five treatment pathways were identified: observation, injection laryngoplasty, voice therapy, laryngeal framework surgery/thyroplasty, and reinnervation surgery. There were 538 patients who underwent observation, 512 injection laryngoplasty, 366 voice therapy, 136 thyroplasty, and 26 laryngeal reinnervation surgery. Males were more likely to undergo injection laryngoplasty than females (OR 1.32; CI 1.08–1.61), whereas females were more likely to undergo voice therapy (OR 1.39; CI 1.09–1.76). Patients with public insurance (OR 1.48; CI 1.03–2.14) and Hispanics (OR 2.60; CI 1.18–5.72) were more likely to undergo thyroplasty. Patients who underwent reinnervation surgery were younger than those in other treatment pathways (median: 39.1 years vs. 50.7–56.1 years). Conclusions Gender, ethnicity, and insurance status were significantly associated with specific UVFP treatment pathways. Patients with public insurance were more likely to undergo surgical intervention than voice therapy. This data overall supports differences in care pathway utilization for UVFP based on social determinants of health. Level of evidence Level IV.}

  journal={Otology \& Neurotology},
  abstract = {Objective 
To identify demographic and clinical features impacting initial treatment pathway for vestibular schwannoma.
Study Design 
Retrospective chart review.
Setting 
Tertiary care academic medical center.
Patients 
Patients diagnosed with vestibular schwannoma between 2009 and 2019.
Interventions 
Observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, or microsurgical resection.
Main Outcome Measures 
χ2 Test, one-way analysis of variance, and multivariate logistic regression were used to correlate demographic and clinical factors with initial treatment pathway for 197 newly diagnosed vestibular schwannoma patients.
Results 
Among 197 patients, 93 (47%) were initially treated with observation, 60 (30%) with stereotactic radiation (Gamma Knife) and 44 (22%) with surgical resection. Age univariately had no statistically significant impact on initial pathway, but those undergoing surgery trended toward a younger demographic (49.1 yr [surgery] versus 57.2 yr [observation] versus 59.0 yr [Gamma Knife]). Men were more likely to be initially observed than women (p = 0.04). Patients initially observed were more likely to have a lower Koos classification (p < 0.001) and have better tumor-ear hearing (p = 0.03). Only 34.4% of patients living outside the local geographic region were initially observed compared with 53.0% living locally (p = 0.055). Surgeon correlated with initial treatment (p = 0.04) but did not maintain significance when adjusting for hearing level or tumor size. A multiple linear regression model found age, maximum tumor diameter, and Koos class to correlate with initial treatment pathway (p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.42).
Conclusion 
Initial treatment pathway for newly diagnosed vestibular schwannoma is impacted by demographic factors such as age, sex, and geographic proximity to the medical center. Clinical features including hearing level and tumor size also correlated with initial treatment modality.},

  author={White, Shane W and Bock, Jonathan M and Blumin, Joel H and Friedland, David R and Adams, Jazzmyne A and Tong, Ling and Osinski, Kristen and Luo, Jake},
  journal={Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology},
  abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the association between patient socioeconomic and demographic factors and tertiary care utilization for dysphonia in a localized metropolitan area of the American Midwest.

Methods
Multivariate regression analysis was used to correlate patient demographics and population level data (e.g., age, gender, race, insurance, median income, education level) with tertiary laryngology utilization for dysphonia care at our institution between 2000 and 2019. Initial analyses characterized tertiary laryngology utilization rates for all regional ZIP codes and correlated these data with census information for household income and education. Dysphonia patient demographics were compared among populations cared for in our entire academic Otolaryngology department, our health system, and the regional population.

Results
Among 1,365,021 patients in our health system, there were 7066 tertiary laryngology visits with a diagnosis of dysphonia. Dysphonia patients as compared to the overall health system were older (62.0 vs. 50.8 years), more likely to be female (63.7 vs. 50.2%) and more likely to have insurance (98.4 vs. 87.5%, all p < .001). Patient and population-level factors including insurance status, education, and black race showed positive correlation with laryngology utilization while median income did not.

Conclusions and Relevance
Insurance status, education level, and race correlated with utilization of tertiary laryngology services for the evaluation of dysphonia in our community, while median income did not. Black patients utilized tertiary laryngology care at higher rates compared to departmental and regional population utilization data. These results underscore important demographic and disease-specific factors that may affect utilization of subspecialty care in Otolaryngology.

  abstract = {Data-driven diagnosis prediction has been adopted in clinical decision support systems. However, only a few studies have focused on non-supervised clustering approaches to building a high-quality patient data set. This study focused on a clustering-aided approach to diagnosis prediction. We leveraged clustering-aided machine learning models to predict elderly falls. First, we used patients' risk factors to build a feature set. The feature set showed a clustering-aided approach could aggregate patient factors that shared similar clinical and demographic characteristics. Subsequently, a K-means clustering approach significantly improved the data set quality. Overall, our study demonstrated that clustering approaches improve the prediction performance of elderly falls. A clustering-aided approach can be applied to similar clinical healthcare practices to potentially improve elderly care.},

  journal={International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology},
  abstract = {Objectives
To measure the impact of social determinants of health and clinical comorbidities on the incidence of post-tympanotomy tube otorrhea (PTTO).

Methods
Retrospective observational cohort study. All children between the ages of 0 and 17 having tympanotomy tube placement between 2009 and 2019. Between group comparisons entailed the calculation of odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values.

Results
Among 12,757 patients who underwent myringotomy and tube placement, 2217 (17.4%) presented with PTTO within 1 year. Race and sex did not correlate with the development of PTTO. Non-Hispanic ethnicity had a negative association with PTTO (OR: 0.80 (0.70-0.91), p < .0001). Insurance status correlated with incidence of PTTO with a higher rate noted among those with public insurance (OR: 1.12 (1.02–1.23), p = .02) and a lower rate among those with private insurance (OR: 0.84 (0.77-0.92), p < .0001). Craniofacial abnormalities had the strongest positive correlation with PTTO, particularly, cleft lip and/or cleft palate (OR>2.24, p < .0001). Immunodeficiency had similar impact on PTTO (OR: 2.38 (1.46–3.91), p < .0001). Asthma and prematurity did not significantly correlate with occurrence of PTTO.

Conclusion
Higher rates of PTTO correlated strongest with clinical factors; particularly craniofacial abnormalities and immunodeficiency. Social determinants, including private insurance and non-Hispanic ethnicity, were associated with lower rates of PTTO. Race and sex did not show significant correlations.},

  abstract = {In the U.S. 5–10% of new pediatric cases of cancer are primary bone tumors. The most common type of primary malignant bone tumor is osteosarcoma. The intention of the present work is to improve the detection and diagnosis of osteosarcoma using computer-aided detection (CAD) and diagnosis (CADx). Such tools as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can significantly decrease the surgeon’s workload and make a better prognosis of patient conditions. CNNs need to be trained on a large amount of data in order to achieve a more trustworthy performance. In this study, transfer learning techniques, pre-trained CNNs, are adapted to a public dataset on osteosarcoma histological images to detect necrotic images from non-necrotic and healthy tissues. First, the dataset was preprocessed, and different classifications are applied. Then, Transfer learning models including VGG19 and Inception V3 are used and trained on Whole Slide Images (WSI) with no patches, to improve the accuracy of the outputs. Finally, the models are applied to different classification problems, including binary and multi-class classifiers. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the VGG19 has the highest, 96%, performance amongst all binary classes and multiclass classification. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on detecting malignancy of Osteosarcoma based on histologic images.},

  journal={OTO open},
  abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study was to determine the impact of patient demographics and socioeconomic factors on the utilization of tertiary rhinology care services in an upper Midwestern academic medical center.
Study Design
Retrospective review of electronic health records.
Setting
Academic medical center.
Methods
The electronic health record of our academic center was interrogated for the demographics and diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) among adult patients seen by fellowship-trained rhinologists from 2000 to 2019. Patient characteristics (age, sex, race, insurance status) and population-level data (median income and education level) were compared with utilization of tertiary rhinology services for CRS. Utilization rates were calculated for each regional zip code and correlated with census data for median income and education. The association between determinants of health and tertiary rhinology utilization was assessed by multivariate regression analyses.
Results
A total of 8325 patients diagnosed with CRS used tertiary rhinology services. Patients were older (median, 58.9 years) and more likely to be female (57.6%), White (85%), and privately insured (60%) when compared with patients seen across our hospital system (P < .001). Adjusted analyses showed median income, education level, and White race to be independently correlated with tertiary care utilization. Private insurance alone was not an independent contributing factor to access.
Conclusion
Utilization of tertiary rhinology services correlated with income, race, and education level. Private insurance was not an independent factor. These results highlight social differences in determinants of access to tertiary otolaryngologic care.

  abstract = {It is known that clinical trials have potential risks for participants, which could result in unexpected adverse events. To quantify and predict the risk of adverse outcomes, we leverage a large amount of clinical reports to build machine learning models to predict adverse outcomes. We focused on death events as the predicting target in this study. From Clinicaltrial.gov, we collected 28,340 reports and transformed the data into vectorized machine learning features. These features were harmonized across studies using semantic mapping and feature selection techniques. The resulting selected clinical trial features were used to build five machine learning models for prediction. We evaluated and compared relative model performances for the prediction task. Results show that the logistic regression algorithm achieved the best overall receiver operating characteristic score at 0.7344. This exploratory study showed that it is feasible to use clinical trial factors to predict adverse outcomes. We demonstrated the approach by focusing on building machine learning models to predict death outcomes. Predicting adverse outcomes could help clinical trials estimate harmful risks and design better mechanisms to protect participants. We hope by using our models, a clinical trial expert will be able to assess whether serious adverse events are likely to occur in a clinical trial at the early stage and to estimate what potential trial factors could contribute to the potential serious adverse events.},

  author={Luo, Lingyun and Tong, Ling and Zhou, Xiaoxi and Mejino Jr, Jose LV and Ouyang, Chunping and Liu, Yongbin},
  abstract = {Organizing the descendants of a concept under a particular semantic relationship may be rather arbitrarily carried out during the manual creation processes of large biomedical terminologies, resulting in imbalances in relationship granularity. This work aims to propose scalable models towards systematically evaluating the granularity balance of semantic relationships. We first utilize “parallel concepts set (PCS)” and two features (the length and the strength) of the paths between PCSs to design the general evaluation models, based on which we propose eight concrete evaluation models generated by two specific types of PCSs: single concept set and symmetric concepts set. We then apply those concrete models to the IS-A relationship in FMA and SNOMED CT’s Body Structure subset, as well as to the Part-Of relationship in FMA. Moreover, without loss of generality, we conduct two additional rounds of applications on the Part-Of relationship after removing length redundancies and strength redundancies sequentially. At last, we perform automatic evaluation on the imbalances detected after the final round for identifying missing concepts, misaligned relations and inconsistencies. For the IS-A relationship, 34 missing concepts, 80 misalignments and 18 redundancies in FMA as well as 28 missing concepts, 114 misalignments and 1 redundancy in SNOMED CT were uncovered. In addition, 6,801 instances of imbalances for the Part-Of relationship in FMA were also identified, including 3,246 redundancies. After removing those redundancies from FMA, the total number of Part-Of imbalances was dramatically reduced to 327, including 51 missing concepts, 294 misaligned relations, and 36 inconsistencies. Manual curation performed by the FMA project leader confirmed the effectiveness of our method in identifying curation errors. In conclusion, the granularity balance of hierarchical semantic relationship is a valuable property to check for ontology quality assurance, and the scalable evaluation models proposed in this study are effective in fulfilling this task, especially in auditing relationships with sub-hierarchies, such as the seldom evaluated Part-Of relationship.},
